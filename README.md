# Random Para Nolep - SOON
## Start 2026
### My Little online Community: https://discord.gg/ufbRBRTKN8

## Target Language Stack
- RUST
- MOVE

## What will we make?
We will make platform education inspired by sui bootcamp, leetcode, codewars, freecodecamp. our target audience is my local community first because RPN already had members that love to learn code and willing to onboard as web 3 developer.

## This is Experimental
### About Wasm Interface Types
I am interested in Wasm Interface Types eventhough that stuff still on proposal but i am very sure that stuff will be implemented as a native on browser like chrome and Firefox. So the frontend will be using rust 🗿

### Frontend - Leptos Framework Rust
For now Leptos still use wasm bindgen, its like to "javascript gluecode" but in the future rust will not facing any "gluecode" stuff

### Have fun
Good luck have fun when build this 😁👍
